<h2>Fall 2023</h2>
As usual, we will continue to focus on recent papers in NLP. At each meeting, we will have a volunteer leading the paper discussion. If you are interested in leading the paper, please fill in your availability <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17y7wGwBkSCq4ZCLCYVTyCmM2m_zGGA6eGmTNPUc6UM4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

   <summary><strong>Spring 2023</strong></summary>
   This semester, we will focus on recent papers in NLP. At each meeting, one student should sign up for giving a short initial summary of the paper and for preparing some questions to get the discussion going. We will also allocate the last two meetings for students to talk about their own research. Students can give an update about their ongoing research in the form of a 10-min presentation. If you are interested in leading the paper or giving a presentation, please fill in your availability <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17y7wGwBkSCq4ZCLCYVTyCmM2m_zGGA6eGmTNPUc6UM4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

   The meetings are held bi-weekly on Mondays 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, starting from Jan 23rd. The meetings will be in hybrid, both at GDC 3.816 and via <a href="https://utexas.zoom.us/j/2413159498">Zoom</a>.
