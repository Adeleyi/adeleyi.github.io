In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello. I’ve been practicing the instrument since I was 4. Here’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqRwfVcFuo3Z_WD9sTbNogYsBFVI6j3f/view?usp=sharing">a video of me playing the piano and the cello as a kid</a> in the Gulang Island (where I was born) Concert Hall. I also enjoy running, going to the gym, hiking, and playing golf in my leisure time.
