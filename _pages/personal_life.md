In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello. I’ve been practicing the instrument since I was 4. Here’s <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90797701/179892169-d7ff8544-0a58-41d9-991a-1d07c5d4fe10.mp4">a video of me playing the piano and the cello as a kid in the Gulang Island (where I was born) Concert Hall</a>.

I also enjoy playing golf and smoking the tobacco pipe in my leisure time.
