Hi, I'm Esther, an NLP Research Fellow at [The African Research Collective](https://blog.taresco.org/), where I contribute to research and projects that advance technology for African languages.

I’m still early in my journey, so I keep an open mind, but here are some research questions I often come back to:

- How can we design NLP systems that truly account for linguistic structures and meanings, given that every language works differently?
- For languages with little or no digital presence, what strategies make sense for building datasets and tools?
  
- How can NLP efforts double as a way to document and preserve these languages for the future?
  
- Even when the technology works, how do we address biases that inevitably creep in?
  
- How can we ensure the systems we build actually serve the communities that need them most?
