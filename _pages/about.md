I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, advised by <a href="https://jessyli.com/">Professor Jessy Li</a>. My research interest is in Natural Language Processing as well as Computational Linguistics, with a focus on pragmatics and discourse. I am part of the <a href="https://www.nlp.utexas.edu/">UT Austin NLP community</a> as well as the <a href="https://asol.ling.utexas.edu/">Associated Students of Linguistics</a>. Usually I go by Henry. My Chinese name is 詹弘立.

I received my B.A. in Linguistics from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2021.
