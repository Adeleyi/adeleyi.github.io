I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, advised by <a href="https://jessyli.com/">Professor Jessy Li</a>.

Previously, I received my B.A. in Linguistics from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.
