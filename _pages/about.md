I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, where I'm blessed to be advised by Professor <a href="https://jessyli.com/">Junyi Jessy Li</a>. My research interest is in Natural Language Processing as well as Computational Linguistics, with a focus on emotions. I am part of the <a href="https://www.nlp.utexas.edu/">UT Austin NLP community</a> as well as the <a href="https://asol.ling.utexas.edu/">Associated Students of Linguistics</a>. Henry is my Starbucks name. My Chinese name is 詹弘立.

<!---- I received my B.A. in English (Linguistics) as an outstanding graduate from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2021. During my undergraduate studies there, I was very fortunate to be guided academically by wonderful professors including Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1814">Xinchao Guan</a>, Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1774">Zhenhua Wang</a>, and Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1931">Fengchao Zhen</a>.-->

You can find my CV [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). Media coverage of my research can be found [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/media_coverage/). The profile photo here was taken at the presentation of my first-ever paper, which was accepted to EMNLP 2022.

I'm also a cellist since 4 years old. In my free time, I like to practice the cello and play golf. You can find more details about my cello journey [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/life/).<!---- I write diaries [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/Hongli_Diaries/).-->
