I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, where I'm blessed to be advised by Professor <a href="https://jessyli.com/">Junyi Jessy Li</a>. The ambition of my research is to <strong>build emotionally intelligent AI systems in a broader social context</strong>. I am part of the <a href="https://www.nlp.utexas.edu/">UT Austin NLP community</a>, and am currently leading the <a href="https://honglizhan.github.io/NLL/">UT Austin Natural Language Learning Reading Group</a>. If you have a paper you're interested in reading, feel free to share it with me, and we can discuss it at the bi-weekly meeting together ;)


<!---- <a href="https://asol.ling.utexas.edu/">Associated Students of Linguistics</a> I received my B.A. in English (Linguistics) as an outstanding graduate from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2021. During my undergraduate studies there, I was very fortunate to be guided academically by wonderful professors including Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1814">Xinchao Guan</a>, Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1774">Zhenhua Wang</a>, and Professor <a href="https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/1931">Fengchao Zhen</a>.

My CV is linked [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). Media coverage of my research can be found [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/media_coverage/). The profile photo was taken at the presentation of my first-ever paper, which was accepted to EMNLP 2022.

Casually, I go by Henry.<br/>

<!---- I'm also a cellist since 4 years old. In my free time, I like to practice the cello and play golf. You can find more details about my cello journey [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/life/). I write diaries [here](https://honglizhan.github.io/Hongli_Diaries/).-->

<!---- My advisor calls me a tweet pro :P-->
